## Data processing scripts

The raw MARC/XML data in ../originals/MARC/regina_export.zip was parsed into raw CSVs stored in unified/kungliga_parsed.zip with the scripts documented in the public [MARCdata](https://github.com/COMHIS/MARCdata) repository. The paths have not been updated here.

The unified/kungliga.zip files are further preprocessed with the scripts in [R repository](https://github.com/rOpenGov/kungliga/blob/master/inst/examples/main.R) (paths and scripts still need to be synced with this gitlab directory structure!).
